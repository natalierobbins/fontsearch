# FontSearch

FontSearch is an ongoing personal project with the goal of allowing natural language exploration of typography. It is currently in the data mining phase, with the font images and metadata of 1,000+ Google Fonts and 65,000+ Font Space fonts scraped and being processed for training. Stay tuned for updates!
